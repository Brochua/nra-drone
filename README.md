# nra-drone 

abstract readMe to provide direction

beginning phase
before designing 3d model the drone
1- design the drone in fusion program to find approximate weight of drone body
2- find motor that can lift weight of drone body + 4*weight of motor (approx. 50g) atleast 1000kv
3- find propellers
building phase
4- mount propellers on motors and see if it spins
5- mount motors on drone body
testing phase
6- code Arduino to make drone simply fly upwards
7- test using Arduino to make drone fly up
8- mount tilting mechanism (gyroscope arduino)
9- code and test tilting mechanism
controller phase
10-figure out how to use a controller to control Arduino.


extra features phase
face rec
camera
etc...


END PHASE
create circuit for the drone to replace Arduino in drone
customize final version of drone
